    "text": "Improved Code Readability\nBy using the pipe operator, your code becomes more readable and follows a natural left-to-right flow. Each step in your data analysis can be clearly separated, making it easier to understand the sequence of transformations applied to the data. This readability is particularly valuable when working collaboratively or revisiting code after a period of time. To make your code even easier to read, it is recommended to move to the next line at the end of each pipe. See example below:\nIt is easier to read this code;\n  Dataset %&gt;% \n  group_by(sex) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean(age))\n……… than to read this;\n  Dataset%&gt;%group_by(sex)%&gt;%summarize(mean(age))\nIn the above code, we are taking our data set and sending (via a pipe) to the group_by function which will group the data set by sex and finally taking the mean of the age variable using the summarize function. If you had, say, 5 steps (i.e., 4 pipes) reading horizontally becomes much harder than vertically."

    "text": "Upon Arrival\n\nOrientation\nMost universities offer orientation programs for international students. These programs are designed to help students adjust to life in the U.S. and understand the academic system.\n\n\nSocial Security Number\nIf you plan to work in the U.S., you’ll need a Social Security number (SSN). You can apply for an SSN at your local Social Security office.\n\n\nBank Account\nOpening a bank account in the U.S. can make managing your finances easier. To open an account, you’ll typically need your passport, I-20 or DS-2019, and proof of address."

Developed by Hadley Wickham and other contributors, this package extends the capabilities of tidyverse by offering functions designed to perform essential inferential tasks. Whether you need to estimate confidence intervals, perform hypothesis testing, or compare groups, the infer package has got you covered."

    "text": "Key Features and Functionalities\n\nPoint Estimates and Confidence Intervals:\nOne of the fundamental tasks in statistical inference is estimating population parameters from a sample. With the infer package, generating point estimates and constructing confidence intervals is a breeze. By leveraging the %&gt;% pipe operator and other tidyverse functions, you can easily summarize your data, compute the point estimates, and calculate confidence intervals.\n\n\nHypothesis Testing:\nThe infer package streamlines hypothesis testing in R. It allows you to compare groups or test against a known value, with a choice between parametric and non-parametric methods. Whether you are dealing with one-sample, two-sample, or paired data, the package offers intuitive functions to conduct t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, and much more.\n\n\nBootstrapping:\nBootstrapping is a powerful resampling technique for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic. The infer package makes bootstrapping easy, enabling you to generate thousands of resamples, calculate confidence intervals, and visualize the results.\n\n\nRegression Inference:\nWhen dealing with regression models, the infer package enables you to assess the statistical significance of coefficients and compare models using the lm() or glm() functions. It also simplifies the process of generating predictions and confidence intervals for the response variable.\n\n\nRandomization Tests:\nRandomization tests, also known as permutation tests, are invaluable when you cannot make assumptions about the underlying data distribution. The infer package empowers you to perform randomization tests effortlessly, helping you draw valid conclusions from non-parametric data."

    "text": "Examples of Statistical Inference with infer\nYou can use the package to perform theory-based or simulation-based inference. I will walk you through how to perform each one of these for a single mean. I will use a data frame called gss (general social survey).\nSuppose we want to use our sample data to test the hypothesis that the population mean time (in hours) is different from 40 (this test is two-sided). Here are the hypotheses in words and in symbols:\n\nNull hypothesis: \\(H_0:\\mu=40\\), the population means is 40 hours.\nAlternative hypothesis: \\(H_a: \\mu \\neq 40\\), the population mean is not 40 hours.\n\n\nSimulation-based inference\n\nCalculate the observed statistic (i.e., sample mean for hours variable), saving it as x_bar.\nx_bar &lt;- gss %&gt;%\nspecify(response = hours) %&gt;%\ncalculate(stat = \"mean\")\nCreate the simulation-based null distribution. Here, we are simulating 1000 statistics (means) which we can then graph (next step) to visualize their distribution:\nnull_dist &lt;- gss %&gt;%\nspecify(response = hours) %&gt;%\nhypothesize(null = \"point\", mu = 40) %&gt;%\ngenerate(reps = 1000) %&gt;%\n  calculate(stat = \"mean\")\n(Optional step) Visualize the (sampling) distribution:\nvisualize(null_dist) +\nshade_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the p-value and write your conclusion:\nnull_dist %&gt;%\nget_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\n\n\nTheory-based (t-test) inference\nThe theory-based inference assumes the t-distribution (must check all conditions) to find the p-value. Below are the steps:\n\nCalculate the observed statistic (the T-score) and save it as t_bar:\nt_bar &lt;- gss %&gt;%\nspecify(response = hours) %&gt;%\nhypothesize(null = \"point\", mu = 40) %&gt;%\ncalculate(stat = \"t\")\nGenerate the null distribution assuming the t-distribution:\nnull_dist_theory &lt;- gss %&gt;%\nspecify(response = hours)  %&gt;%\nassume(\"t\")\nVisualize\nvisualize(null_dist_theory) +\nshade_p_value(obs_stat = t_bar, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the p-value for your test and write the conclusion:\nnull_dist %&gt;%\nget_p_value(obs_stat = t_bar, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\nTo learn more about how to use infer for inference on other statistics, visit the infer website. The website also provides ways to create confidence intervals, which are are a very important part of statistical inference."
